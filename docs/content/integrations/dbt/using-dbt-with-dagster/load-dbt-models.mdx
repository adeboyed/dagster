# Using dbt with Dagster, part two: Load dbt models as Dagster assets

<Note>
  This is part two of the{" "}
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster">
    Using dbt with Dagster software-defined assets
  </a>{" "}
  tutorial.
</Note>

At this point, you should have a [fully-configured dbt project](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/set-up-dbt-project) that's ready to work with Dagster.

In this step, you'll finally begin integrating dbt with Dagster! To do this, you'll:

- [Load the dbt models into Dagster as assets](#step-1-load-the-dbt-models-as-assets)
- [Define a Dagster code location](#step-2-define-a-dagster-code-location)
- [View the assets in Dagit](#step-3-view-the-assets-in-dagit)

---

## Step 1: Load the dbt models as assets

In this step, you'll load the dbt models into Dagster as assets using the [`dagster-dbt`](/\_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt) library.

Open the `__init__.py` file, located in `/tutorial_template/tutorial_dbt_dagster/assets`, and add the following code:

```python
from dagster_dbt import load_assets_from_dbt_project

from dagster import file_relative_path


DBT_PROJECT_PATH = file_relative_path(__file__, "../../jaffle_shop")

dbt_assets = load_assets_from_dbt_project(project_dir=DBT_PROJECT_PATH, key_prefix=["jaffle_shop"])
```

Let's discuss what this example is doing, specifically the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> function. This function loads dbt models into Dagster as assets, creating one Dagster asset for each model.

When invoked, this function:

1. Compiles your dbt project,
2. Parses the metadata provided by dbt, and
3. Generates a set of software-defined assets reflecting the models in the project. These assets share the same underlying [op](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops), which will invoke dbt to run the models represented by the loaded assets.

<Note>
  <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="load_assets_from_dbt_project" /> is one
  of two ways you can load dbt models into Dagster, which we recommend for small
  dbt projects. For larger projects, we recommend using
  <a href="/integrations/dbt/reference#loading-models-using-load_assets_from_dbt_manifest">
    <code>load_assets_from_dbt_manifest</code> to load models from a dbt{" "}
    <code>manifest.json</code> file
  </a>.
</Note>

Let's take a look at the arguments we've supplied:

- `project_dir`, which is the path to the dbt project
- `key_prefix`, which is a prefix to apply to all models in the dbt project

---

## Step 2: Define a Dagster code location

Next, you'll define the code location for your Dagster project. A [code location](/concepts/code-locations), created using the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object, is a collection of definitions in a Dagster project, such as assets, resources, and so on.

Assets loaded from dbt require a dbt resource, which is responsible for firing off dbt CLI commands. Using the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DbtCli" /> resource, we can supply a dbt resource to the dbt project.

Open the `__init__.py` file, located in `/tutorial_template/tutorial_dbt_dagster`, and add the following code:

```python
import os

from dagster_dbt import DbtCli
from tutorial_dbt_dagster import assets
from tutorial_dbt_dagster.assets import DBT_PROJECT_PATH

from dagster import Definitions, load_assets_from_modules

resources = {"dbt": DbtCli(project_dir=DBT_PROJECT_PATH)}

defs = Definitions(assets=load_assets_from_modules([assets]), resources=resources)
```

Let's take a look at what's happening here:

- In the `resources` key, we've provided configuration info for the <PyObject module="dagster_dbt" object="DbtCli" /> resource.
- Added all assets in the assets module and the resources mapped to the `resources` key to the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object. This supplies the resource we created to our assets.
- Using <PyObject object="load_assets_from_modules" />, we've added all assets in the `assets` module as definitions. This approach allows any new assets we created to be automatically included in the code location instead of needing to manually add them one by one.

---

## Step 3: View the assets in Dagit

In this step you'll start Dagit, Dagster's web interface.

1. To start Dagit, run the following in `/tutorial_template`:

   ```shell
   dagster dev
   ```

   Which will result in output similar to:

   ```shell
   Serving dagit on http://127.0.0.1:3000 in process 70635
   ```

2. In your browser, navigate to <http://127.0.0.1:3000>. The page will display the assets:

   <Image
   alt="Asset graph in Dagit, containing dbt models loaded as Dagster assets"
   src="/images/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/load-dbt-models-dbt-asset-graph.png"
   width={1090}
   height={894}
   />

---

## What's next?

At this point, you've loaded your dbt models into Dagster as assets, supplied them with a dbt resource, and viewed them in Dagit's asset graph. The next step is to [add upstream Dagster assets and kick off a run that materializes them](/integrations/dbt/using-dbt-with-dagster/upstream-assets).
